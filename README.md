## 

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I developed a 7-page website that looks exactly like its corresponding Figma file layout-wise.

The Figma file is open-source (https://www.figma.com/community/file/1361750418519368745).

The Figma file has only desktop views so I designed the layout for mobile screens and implemented it using media queries.

## Features

- Semantic HTML
- Responsiveness (via CSS)
- JavaScript carousel and mobile menu
